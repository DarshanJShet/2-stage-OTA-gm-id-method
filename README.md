# Two-Stage OTA using gm/Id Method

This project presents the **design, analysis, and simulation of a Two-Stage Operational Transconductance Amplifier (OTA)** using the **gm/Id methodology** in CMOS technology. The gm/Id approach enables efficient design-space exploration by linking the device‚Äôs transconductance efficiency (gm/Id) to its biasing and sizing, allowing optimized trade-offs between **gain**, **bandwidth**, **power**, and **area**.

## üìò Project Overview

The two-stage OTA is widely used in analog and mixed-signal systems such as ADCs, filters, and amplifiers.  
This design focuses on achieving:
- **High DC gain**
- **Adequate phase margin for stability**
- **Low power consumption**
- **Reasonable unity gain bandwidth (UGB)**

The OTA consists of:
1. **Input Differential Pair** with active load (first stage)
2. **Common-source second stage** to boost gain
3. **Miller Compensation Network** to enhance phase margin and ensure frequency stability

## ‚öôÔ∏è gm/Id Methodology

The **gm/Id methodology** is a modern design approach that relates the transconductance of a MOS transistor (**gm**) to its drain current (**Id**). This ratio serves as a key figure of merit, allowing designers to select the optimal operating region ‚Äî **weak**, **moderate**, or **strong inversion** ‚Äî based on desired performance parameters such as **gain**, **speed**, **linearity**, and **power efficiency**.

By using pre-generated **gm/Id curves**, transistor sizing and biasing can be carried out systematically, making the design process more intuitive and efficient compared to traditional trial-and-error techniques.

This methodology provides a structured way to perform transistor-level design, ensuring predictable trade-offs between **speed**, **power**, and **accuracy**. In this project, it is used to determine the sizing of MOS transistors for the **two-stage OTA**, ensuring that both **high gain** and **power efficiency** targets are achieved.
